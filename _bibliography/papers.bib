    abstract  = {Due to the scale ambiguity problem, the performance  of monocular depth estimation (MDE) is inherently restricted. Multi-camera systems, especially those equipped with active depth cameras, have addressed this problem at the expense of increased hardware costs and space. In this Letter, we adopt a similar but costeffective solution using only single-pixel depth guidance with a single-photon avalanche diode. To this end, we design a single-pixel guidance module (SPGM) that combines the global information from the single-pixel depth guidance with the spatial information from the image at the feature level. By integrating SPGMs into an MDE network, we introduce PhoMoNet, the first end-to-end MDE network with single-pixel depth guidance. Experimental results show the effectiveness and superiority of PhoMoNet over state-of-the-art MDE networks on synthetic and real-world datasets.},
